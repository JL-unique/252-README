Math used to adjust time/serving:

For Baking, to double the quantities, try the following:

Remove 1/3 of the cooking time.
Double the remaining amount.
Add your original third back on.
So If you're doubling something that would take 1 hour to bake.

Remove 1/3 (Leaving 40 minutes)
Double this new amount (Giving 80 minutes)
Add your original 1/3 back on. (100 minutes)
You may need to play around with the temperatures to make sure that you're not burning the outside.
